\begin{ntdedicatory}

To my family, my steadfast anchor in every storm.
Through all the obstacles of my path, and to where it has led me, your constant presence, unwavering belief, and enduring faith never left my side.
Even when I doubted myself, I found in you the certainty I lacked.
This achievement is as much yours as it is mine. Born of your resilience, your love, and the trust you always placed in me.
