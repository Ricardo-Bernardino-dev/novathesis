\begin{ntquote}[8cm][Napoleon Bonaparte][Letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs (26 September 1797)][Emperor of the French and military leader][en]
  All great events hang by a hair. The man of ability takes advantage of everything and neglects nothing that can give him a chance of success; whilst the less able man sometimes loses everything by neglecting a single one of those chances.
\end{ntquote}
